# Some Python libraries contain C extensions that must be compiled at install time.
# For example: psycopg2, numpy, pandas, scipy, cryptography, etc.
# If you use the source distributions of those packages (sdist), 
# then pip tries to compile them → which requires gcc hence the 'build-essential package'.

# If your app uses only pure Python packages (Flask, Gunicorn, Requests,
# SQLAlchemy, etc.), then you can remove 'build-essential gcc' entirely.

# In this case, we:
# Install compilers temporarily during build.
# Then remove them later to reduce image size.
# We also clean up apt cache to reduce image size.
